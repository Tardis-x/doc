### What is Project TARDIS?

The main IDEA of this project is to create useful tools to control all who attend DevFests and make more fun for visitors.

### Why we run project TARDIS?

Any DevFest Organizer wanted to know where are all speakers and volunteers :)
DevFest is the best place to demonstrate powerful of the new solutions. Such as nearby SDK, Eddystone, FireBase e.t.c.

### Who can be part of the team?

Anybody who want to be a part of the team. You need just sent request, read the rule, take any open issues and go go go

### Why the name is TARDIS?

As one of the main goals of our IDEA is "total control" of all who attend the DevFest, the application will collect a lot of data, location of people, session, voting system e.t.c. So they will be bigger for all who inside of organization process of DevFest, than for people who just attend the event
